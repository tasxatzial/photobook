Third station -> Mesoamerican Pyramids

== Some history ==

Mesoamerican pyramids or pyramid-shaped structures form a prominent part of
ancient Mesoamerican architecture. Although similar to each other in some ways
these New World structures with their flat tops (many with temples on the top)
and their stairs bear only a very weak architectural resemblance to Egyptian
pyramids. The Mesoamerican region's largest pyramid by volume – the
largest pyramid in the world by volume – is the Great Pyramid of Cholula, in the
east-central Mexican state of Puebla. The builders of certain classic
Mesoamerican pyramids have decorated them copiously with stories about the Hero
Twins, the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl, Mesoamerican creation myths,
ritualistic sacrifice, etc.written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of
the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within.

== Early flood -> a myth like the Tower of Babel ==

Popol Vuh (also Popol Wuj or Popul Vuh) is a text recounting the mythology
and history of the Kʼicheʼ people, one of the Maya peoples, who inhabit the
Guatemalan Highlands northwest of present-day Guatemala City.

The Popol Vuh is a foundation narrative of the Kʼicheʼ before the Spanish
conquest of Guatemala. It includes the Mayan creation myth, the exploits of
the Hero Twins Hunahpú and Xbalanqué, and a chronicle of the Kʼicheʼ people.

Mud men from the Popol Vuh

The Popol-Vuh, the sacred book of the Maya, contains within its creation story a
tale of the destruction of the first beings by a flood. This flood differs from
others in that it is not a punishment, but rather a remedy for a faulty
creation. The Feathered Serpent first created man from mud. These creatures were
a failure; they couldn't see, they dissolved when it rained, etc. So the god
broke them up and tried again.

"This time he made men out of wood. They were better than the mud-men. They
could walk and talk; they had many children, built many houses, but they had no
minds nor souls nor hearts.

The Feathered Serpent was disappointed with what he had created, so he sent a
great flood to cleanse the earth of his mistake.

== ASCII ART the Aztec calendar

Xiuhpōhualli is the Aztec year (xihuitl) count (pōhualli). One year consists of
360 named days and 5 nameless (nēmontēmi). These 'extra' days are thought to be
unlucky. The year was broken into 18 periods of twenty days each, sometimes
compared to the Julian month. The Nahuatl word for moon is metztli but whatever
name was used for these periods is unknown. Through Spanish usage, the 20-day
period of the Aztec calendar has become commonly known as a veintena.
